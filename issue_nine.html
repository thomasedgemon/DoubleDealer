            “Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. 
            And my hearty greetings to the citizens of this fair city and state viewing 
            this announcement via public television, or listening on their radios and 
            streaming apps. A special thanks to my staff and the present media for 
            arranging this conference on such short notice. What we have today is something special. 
            As you are all aware, this city has just completed our landmark road and transportation 
            project, officially titled the Northwest Corridor, including its landmark elevated highway. 
            This project has been almost five years in the making, requiring the dedication of thousands 
            upon thousands of man-hours, millions of tax-payer dollars and my administration’s meticulous planning. 
            Now, we finally witness the fruits of our labor. Enjoy! But, you know, I couldn’t help but notice…”
           <br>
           <br>
           Governor Hampton Dickens looked at his staff to his left and right, their support held firmly in their eyes, 
           their quick reassuring nods. With barrel-chested pride, he continued...
           <br>
           <br>
           “If you look around our great metropolis, this great state, even this great country, you might have noticed 
            a lot of names on those roads, those bridges. Some of which are known to citizens throughout this great land.
            Names so important to our history that we need only know their last name. Washington. Lincoln. Eisenhower. 
            Douglas...Fredrick. Tubman. But some of these names, well, some have that little stench of privilege and influence, 
            the odorous byproduct of wealth and nepotism. Of knowing the right people at the right time. I am here today to offer 
            a little change in a big way. To set an example. To evolve toward progress. And, hopefully, when all is said and done, 
            maybe even set a precedent of consideration and, most importantly, recognition for those American workers who have 
            built these roads, but have never driven past their own name. Built these buildings, but don’t see their name in the 
            skyline. Heck, built this room but wouldn’t be allowed in under the circumstances. It gives me great pleasure to announce 
            to you today, that the Northwest Corridor will be named in memorium of the first person to be deceased on it.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Hampton stepped back to receive their gasp of applause. He beamed his teeth to and fro, illuminating the audience.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Who might that be? Only time will tell, but we’re out here wronging what rights we can, and I have faith that this 
            is a big step in the right direction, the direction of a brighter and equitable future. The bridge opens today 
            at 5 p.m., just in time for rush-hour relief. Thank you for your time. God bless you, God bless this state and....”
            <br>
            <br>
            God Bless America

            John Smith did a double-take at the television.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Holy shit,” he muttered.
            <br>
            <br>
            He had been on a master mason on that very project and about every city project for the past half a century. 
            That had been his last job before retirement, and it was good one, far as infrastructure goes. Once upon a 
            time, he had been a civil engineer but he was never any good at the politics and, ultimately, 
            just wanted to be outside with the fellas.
            <br>
            <br>
            Retirement hadn’t suited him well. Felt like not much compared to building a civilization. He’d work around 
            the house but always end up bitching over beers with his Union buddies, their bodies racked with years of work. 
            Many of them halfway to falling apart, but their pride in tact. All the politicians and family members just 
            waved their hands, saying he should be proud of the city he had literally poured the foundations for. 
            The only consolation he felt was knowing the history of buildings--half of which he wouldn’t be allowed in 
            under the circumstances--and the innerworkings of the road systems, which frankly no one else seemed to give 
            a shit about. He’d thought about writing a book on Eisenhower’s Interstate system.
            <br>
            <br>
            The TV returned to its regularly scheduled programming and the audience laughed at him sitting there 
            in his over-stuffed chair, doing nothing but waiting to die.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fuck it.
            <br>
            <br>
            He didn’t know why but he popped his daily pills, too many to count. His daughter was the expert in all that. 
            She’d stop by every Sunday with her potato of a husband sitting in the car, while she dropped off lasagna or 
            some other microwaveable shit, and then, halfway out the door, give her reason why she couldn’t stay long.
            <br>
            <br>
            But this wasn’t going to be because of loneliness, some cry for attention crap. Not at all. Spite, maybe.
            <br>
            <br>
            He put on his old ballcap and walked out of his house. Well, he called it his. He’d had to refinance to 
            help the kids out, so the bank owned it a few years yet. Homeowner, my ass.
            <br>
            <br>
            But still, pride burned inside him. That was a good looking house, the lawn was nice and cropped. He’d been 
            given a responsibility and he’d taken it as far as he could go. His daughter and son, for all they were or 
            weren’t worth now, had been given a good childhood there. He’d tried the flower garden thing, but they were 
            too fragile for his liking, so he just hired the work out. Had a couple plums and an apple tree. Those 
            rocking chairs toward the West looked just like the American dream used to, ought 
            to...should’ve, could’ve, would’ve.
            <br>
            <br>
            He climbed slowly into in his old Chevy, the toolbox in the back won from a raffle long ago, and drove
            to the nearest Waffle House.
            <br>
            <br>
            His daddy had taken him to the original when he was a boy, and they had started a tradition from there. 
            Every New Year’s morning, they’d make the long drive into the city for a good meal. Just the boys. His 
            mama would be busy at home with the girls preparing the New Year’s meal of cornbread, greens and 
            black-eyed peas. Rutabaga for just his mama and him. Fried pork chops when the last year had been a good year.
            <br>
            <br>
            He ordered a pecan waffle, slab of country ham and a coffee, and watched, wishing he could still smoke indoors.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cars streamed by on what used to be dirt-top. He sipped his coffee. Was it a hive or was it the speed of life? 
            He couldn’t decide anymore. Used not to honk at least.
            <br>
            <br>
            His food came, and the waitress was pretty and smiled. He winked at her, and she winked back. It was delicious 
            as always, but they’d taken the logo out the middle of the waffle to make it smaller. Dumbasses have a company 
            named Waffle House and then change the waffle. Change something else, godammit.
            <br>
            <br>
            He’d tried to blame it on old age, the generation gap, but that doesn’t mean people were getting any smarter. 
            He didn’t begrudge much from the people he saw, but everywhere he looked he could see parts of his own life, 
            and people never knowing what it took to build.
